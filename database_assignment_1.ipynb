They help maintain data integrity by preventing invalid data from being entered or updated in the database. By enforcing these rules, constraints ensure that the data stored in the database is always valid and meaningful.\n",

        "Examples of Common Types of Constraints\n",
        "\n",

        "NOT NULL: This constraint ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. It enforces the presence of data in a specific column.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: emp_name TEXT NOT NULL in the employees table would prevent inserting a record without an employee name.\n",
        "\n",
        "UNIQUE: This constraint ensures that all values in a column or group of columns are unique. It prevents duplicate entries in the specified column(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: email TEXT UNIQUE in the employees table would ensure that each employee has a unique email address.\n",
        "\n",
        "PRIMARY KEY: This constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. It combines the properties of NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL in the employees table designates emp_id as the primary key, ensuring each employee has a unique identifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "FOREIGN KEY: This constraint establishes a relationship between two tables by linking a column in one table (the child table) to the primary key column in another table (the parent table). It ensures referential integrity by preventing invalid relationships between tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If you had a departments table with a primary key dept_id, you could add a dept_id column to the employees table and define it as a foreign key referencing the departments table. This would ensure that each employee is associated with a valid department.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHECK: This constraint allows you to define a specific condition that must be met for data to be inserted or updated in a column. It provides flexibility in defining custom validation rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: age INT CHECK (age >= 18) in the employees table ensures that all employees are at least 18 years old.\n",
        "\n",
        "DEFAULT: This constraint provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during insertion. It ensures that a column always has a value, even if it's not explicitly provided.\n",

        "Data Consistency: By enforcing the presence of a value, it helps maintain data consistency across the database.\n",
        "Referential Integrity: If the column is used as a foreign key, the NOT NULL constraint ensures that it can be reliably linked to the primary key in another table.\n",
        "Query Optimization: Queries that rely on the column can be optimized, as the database can assume that the column always contains a value.\n",
        "Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is a fundamental principle of relational database design. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unique Identification: The primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table. If a primary key could be NULL, it would be impossible to distinguish between records with NULL values in the primary key column.\n",
        "Referential Integrity: Primary keys are often used as foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships. Allowing NULL values in a primary key would break referential integrity, as foreign keys would not be able to reliably link to the primary key.\n",
        "Data Consistency: By ensuring that primary keys are always unique and non-null, it helps maintain data consistency and prevents data corruption.\n",
        "Justification\n",
        "\n",
        "The requirement for primary keys to be non-null is enforced by the database management system (DBMS). When you define a primary key constraint, the DBMS automatically adds a NOT NULL constraint to the primary key column(s). This ensures that the fundamental principles of primary keys are always upheld.\n",
        "\n",
