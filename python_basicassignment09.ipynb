        "\n",
        "I/O-bound tasks: When a program spends a lot of time waiting for input/output operations (e.g., reading from a file, making network requests), multithreading can improve performance by allowing other threads to execute while one thread is waiting.\n",
        "Tasks with shared resources: If tasks need to access and modify shared data frequently, multithreading can be more efficient as threads share the same memory space, eliminating the need for inter-process communication.\n",
        "Faster context switching: Switching between threads is generally faster than switching between processes, making multithreading more suitable for tasks that require frequent context switches.\n",
        "Example: A web server handling multiple client requests concurrently could benefit from multithreading. While one thread is waiting for a client's request, other threads can process other requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing, on the other hand, involves creating multiple processes, each with its own memory space. This is preferred in scenarios where:\n",
        "\n",
        "CPU-bound tasks: When a program is computationally intensive and requires significant processing power, multiprocessing can leverage multiple CPU cores to execute tasks in parallel, resulting in faster execution.\n",
        "Tasks requiring isolation: If tasks need to be isolated from each other to prevent interference or data corruption, multiprocessing is a better choice as each process has its own memory space.\n",
        "Avoiding the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the GIL limits the execution of multiple threads within a single process, hindering true parallelism. Multiprocessing bypasses this limitation by using multiple processes.\n",
        "Example: Performing complex calculations, image processing, or scientific simulations could benefit from multiprocessing as these tasks can be divided into independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel on different cores.\n",

It acts as a manager for distributing tasks among these worker processes, enabling parallel execution and efficient resource utilization. The multiprocessing.Pool class in Python provides a convenient way to create and manage process pools.\n",

        "Simplified Task Submission: With a process pool, you can submit tasks using simple methods like apply, map, and imap. These methods abstract away the complexities of managing individual processes, making parallel programming more convenient.\n",
